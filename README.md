## Why

The MOTD (Message of the Day) on a Linux system is a feature that displays
a message or information to users when they log into the system. The purpose
of the MOTD can vary, but it is commonly used to convey important information
to users such as system updates, news, or status information.

Ubuntu server use the landscape-sysinfo and we want more details and more fun.
